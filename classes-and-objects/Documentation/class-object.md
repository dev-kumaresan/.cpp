## classes and objects -
<p>Everything in C++ is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes. (data members or variables) and (methods or member functions).</p>
<p>For Example, In real life, classroom is the class. The class has attributes., such as boys,girls,desks,windows,fan. and methods such as students, staff(s), accessories.</p><br>

### In Program -
* <p>The class, its name is a user-defined data type that we can use in our program that contains variables and functions created by user.</p>
* <p>And it works only when object created by the user, from the main. by use of a object, we access class attributes.</p> 
### structure to create the class -
<center>
<b>class class_name { <br>
<b>public:<br>
<b>// variables and functions<br>
<b>};<br>
<b>int main() {<br>
<b>class_name object;<br>
<b>object.variable;<br>
<b>object.function();<br>
<b>}
</center>
